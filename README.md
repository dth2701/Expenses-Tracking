# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is an application that will help users keep track of their spending on a yearly basis. It's intended to provide users with an overview of their financial habits and help them manage their budget more effectively.
